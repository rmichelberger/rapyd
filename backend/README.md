# Backend ðŸ’»
A lightweigth middleware was developed with TypeScript and node js, deployed to firebase. It's used only to not to expose the Rapyd Credentials (secret key). Most probably I could've used the Mobile SDK directly without the backend, but at the time I've started with the project, there was no Rapyd Mobile SDK compatible with latest Xcode version.
